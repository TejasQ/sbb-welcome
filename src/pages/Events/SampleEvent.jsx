Many Christians struggle to develop a rich and consistent habit of Bible reading and prayer.\n\nWe are excited that Buddy Owens is coming to Berlin to teach this new workshop called \"Deeper Devotions\". Deeper Devotions will help you to hear God speak in the Bible and to respond to him in conversational prayer, without feeling guilty or worrying about how much (or how little) time you have. In short, Deeper Devotions will teach you the secrets to real friendship with God. \n\nBuddy Owens is a teaching pastor at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California. He is the author of “Finding God in the desert of the soul”, “The Way of a Worshiper: Discover the Secret to Friendship with God”, and the General Editor of The NIV Worship Bible. \n\nSPACE IS LIMITED... so please register with Constanze at office@saddleback.de.\n\nFor our lunch break, we ask that you bring a packed lunch or take care of yourself in one of the nearby restaurants.\nBring a pen and a bible. There will also be printed materials for all participants.\n\nNote: The written materials will be in English only, but we will provide German translations for what will be said.",
