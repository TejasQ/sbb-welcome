Weird data passed into SlidyText.
Please pass in an array of text rows, like this:
['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3'].

Also, make sure you've wrapped them in {} in JSX,
so it looks like:
<SlidyText>{['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3']}</SlidyText>

If it still doesn't work, please open a GitHub issue
here: <LINK> and someone (me) will fix it asap.

Sorry! ☹️
